# Learning Sequence-Space Jacobian Method

This repository contains my learning materials and notes for studying the Sequence-Space Jacobian (SSJ) method, based on the original [sequence-jacobian](https://github.com/shade-econ/sequence-jacobian) repository by shade-econ.

## Repository Structure

The main learning materials are in the `notebooks/` directory, which includes several example models:

- `rbc.ipynb`: Real Business Cycle model implementation
- `two_asset.ipynb`: Two-Asset HANK model
- `labor_search.ipynb`: Labor Search model
- `krusell_smith.ipynb`: Krusell-Smith model
- `hank.ipynb`: Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) model

## About Sequence-Space Jacobian Method

The Sequence-Space Jacobian (SSJ) method is a powerful tool for solving heterogeneous-agent models. It provides:
- Fast and accurate solutions for complex dynamic models
- Efficient handling of heterogeneity and aggregate shocks
- Clear separation between model equations and solution method

## Learning Notes

[This section will be updated as I progress through the materials]
